prediction_horizon : number of steps to predict, and number of
                     steps to compute control inputs over.
                     Naming of this variable is improper. Should
                     there be two variables, one for prediction
                     and one for control?
n_coincide : number of steps to coincide for (R)MCC
control_horizon : means how many steps of control input to actuate.
                  Naming of this variable is improper. It should be
                  actuation horizon?
